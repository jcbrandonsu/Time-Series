Time Series Analysis of U.S. Electricity Prices
Prediction of Average Electricity Price per Kilowatt-Hour in U.S. Cities.

Description: This repository contains the Time Series Analysis project that I completed for a graduate PSTAT course at UCSB in 2024. 

The project focuses on modeling and forecasting the average electricity price per kilowatt-hour in U.S. cities using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics by using both SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) Model and State Space Model. 

Key components of the analysis include:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identification of trends, seasonality, and anomalies in the data. \
Model Development: Implementation of SARIMA and State Space Models, with parameter tuning based on ACF and PACF plots. \
Model Evaluation: Out-of-sample forecast evaluation using various error metrics to compare the performance of both models.

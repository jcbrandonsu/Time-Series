Time Series Analysis of U.S. Electricity Prices
Prediction of Average Electricity Price per Kilowatt-Hour in U.S. Cities

Description: This repository contains the Time Series Analysis project that I completed for a graduate PSTAT course at UCSB in 2024.

The project focuses on modeling and forecasting the average electricity price per kilowatt-hour in U.S. cities using both the SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) Model and the State Space Model.

Key Components of the Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Identification of trends, seasonality, and anomalies in the data.
Model Development:

Implementation of SARIMA and State Space Models.
Parameter tuning based on ACF and PACF plots.
Model Evaluation:

Out-of-sample forecast evaluation using various error metrics to compare the performance of both models.
Data
The data folder contains the dataset on average electricity prices from January 2000 to February 2020, comprising 252 data points. The data was collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics from 75 urban areas on a monthly basis using mail questionnaires administered by the Department of Energy.
